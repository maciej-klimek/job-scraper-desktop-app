# Java Job Scraper

A project created for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at **ICT, AGH University of Science and Technology**. 

This application is entirely developed in **Java** and demonstrates fundamentals of object-oriented programming alongside basic web scraping functionality.

This project helped me understand:
- The basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
- Java fundamentals.  
- Basic web scraping techniques using Jsoup.  
- Building an application from scratch, including UI and logging functionalities.  
- Implementing simple multithreading to enhance the app performance.  

It is one of my first applications built from scratch. While it is far from perfect, working on this project taught me the fundamentals of OOP and gave me practical experience in creating a complete application.
